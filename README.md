Welcome to **SEAN.JS** Stack Official Yeoman Generator

**SEAN.JS** is a Full-Stack Javascript for an easy starting point with [**S**equilizeJS](http://sequelize.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), [**E**xpressJS](http://expressjs.com/), [**A**ngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [**N**odeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) based applications.
It is designed to give you a quick and organized way to start developing SEAN based web apps.

## Configured with
* [RedisStore](https://github.com/optimalbits/node_acl): Redis session store backed by node_redis, and is insanely fast!
* [ACL](https://github.com/optimalbits/node_acl): An Access Control List module, based on Redis with Express middleware support
* [Async](https://github.com/caolan/async): Higher-order functions and common patterns for asynchronous code
* [Passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport): Simple, unobtrusive authentication for Node.js (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google and PayPal)
* [Socket.io](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io): Node.js realtime framework server
* [reCaptcha](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html): Tough on bots Easy on humans
* [Nodemailer](https://github.com/andris9/Nodemailer): Send e-mails with Node.JS â€“ easy as cake!
* And many more...

Based on **MEAN Stack**

### Live Example: [http://seanjs.herokuapp.com](http://seanjs.herokuapp.com)

---
### For quick development and deployment:

**Install:**
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)


Using Docker, you don't have to install any prerequisites on your machine.
Just install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation), run `docker-compose up` and you are up and running!

You will have these containers created for you:

* Nodejs (4.2.3)
* PostgreSQL (Latest)
* Redis (Latest)


Local development and testing with compose:
```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

> Note: You might need to try this command `eval "$(docker-machine env default)"` in the project directory root to activate Docker

*By default, the url will be: [http://192.168.99.100:3000](http://192.168.99.100:3000)*

---

### Installation

### Before you start, make sure you have these prerequisites installed:

 * PostgreSQL 9.4 or MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and MSSQL *(Depending on your project but SEAN.JS defaults to PostgreSQL 9.4)*
 * Redis Server
 * Node.js
 * NPM

---

##### Using Yeoman Generator:

Check [SEAN.JS Stack Official Yeoman Generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-seanjs)

```sh
$  npm install -g yo
```
**Note:** Your user might not have the permissions to install package globally, so use a super user or **sudo**.

Once you have *yo* installed, you will need to install the **SEAN.JS** Stack generator as well:

```bash
$  npm install -g generator-seanjs
```

```bash
$ yo seanjs
```

You are now ready to get started with the SEAN.JS generator. The generator will help you create a SEAN application.

---

##### Using Command Line:

> **For MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and MSSQL**

> Please replace:
* [user.server.model.js](https://gist.github.com/Massad/3986f4b12d871de8d353#file-user-server-model-js-L6) with `/modules/users/server/models/user.server.model.js`
* [user.authentication.server.controller.js](https://gist.github.com/Massad/f6f649d60ad3009f7b99#file-user-authentication-server-controller-js-L6) with `/modules/users/server/controllers/users/user.authentication.server.controller.js`


> And update your database in the `config/env/`

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/seanjs-stack/seanjs.git seanjs
```
```bash
$ cd seanjs
```

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g bower
```

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

```bash
$ sudo npm install
```
You might notice some `errors` but if you hit `node server.js` and it's working, simply ignore them.

```bash
$ bower install --alow-root
```

```bash
$ node server.js
```

---

## Running Your Application
After the install process is over, you'll be able to run your application using Grunt, just run grunt default task:

```
$ grunt
```

Your application should run on port 3000 with the *development* environment configuration, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

That's it! Your application should be running. To proceed with your development, check the other sections in this documentation.
If you encounter any problems, try the Troubleshooting section.

* explore `config/env/development.js` for development environment configuration options

### Running in Production mode
To run your application with *production* environment configuration, execute grunt as follows:

```bash
$ grunt prod
```

* explore `config/env/production.js` for production environment configuration options

### Running with TLS (SSL)
Application will start by default with secure configuration (SSL mode) turned on and listen on port 8443.
To run your application in a secure manner you'll need to use OpenSSL and generate a set of self-signed certificates. Unix-based users can use the following command:

```bash
$ sh ./scripts/generate-ssl-certs.sh
```

Windows users can follow instructions found [here](http://www.websense.com/support/article/kbarticle/How-to-use-OpenSSL-and-Microsoft-Certification-Authority).
After you've generated the key and certificate, place them in the *config/sslcerts* folder.

Finally, execute grunt's prod task `grunt prod`
* enable/disable SSL mode in production environment change the `secure` option in `config/env/production.js`


## Testing Your Application
You can run the full test suite included with SEANJS with the test task:

```bash
$ grunt test
```

This will run both the server-side tests (located in the app/tests/ directory) and the client-side tests (located in the public/modules/*/tests/).

To execute only the server tests, run the test:server task:

```bash
$ grunt test:server
```

And to run only the client tests, run the test:client task:

```bash
$ grunt test:client
```

---
## Heroku Database - Testing

After installing the **SEAN.JS** if you didn't setup the `postgresql` database yet.
You can run this command to run the application on a testing heroku database:

`DB_NAME="dfuue4lro8u0qk" DB_HOST="ec2-54-217-240-205.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com" DB_USERNAME="xjwecgnyhogzdw" DB_PASSWORD="iH1awetnARl9-HltdMqMWuF0dN" DB_SSL=true node server.js`

And you can see the changes in the database also here http://seanjs.herokuapp.com

Look for `config/env/heroku_example.js` for more info

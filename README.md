Welcome to **SEAN.JS** Stack Official Yeoman Generator

**SEAN.JS** is a Full-Stack Javascript for an easy starting point with [**S**equilizeJS](http://sequelize.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), [**E**xpressJS](http://expressjs.com/), [**A**ngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [**N**odeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) based applications.
It is designed to give you a quick and organized way to start developing SEAN based web apps.

## Configured with
* [RedisStore](https://github.com/optimalbits/node_acl): Redis session store backed by node_redis, and is insanely fast!
* [ACL](https://github.com/optimalbits/node_acl): An Access Control List module, based on Redis with Express middleware support
* [Async](https://github.com/caolan/async): Higher-order functions and common patterns for asynchronous code
* [Passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport): Simple, unobtrusive authentication for Node.js (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google and PayPal)
* [Socket.io](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io): Node.js realtime framework server
* And many more...

Based on **MEAN Stack**

### Installation

### Before you start, make sure you have these prerequisites installed:
 * PostgreSQL 9.4 or MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and MSSQL *(Depending on your project but SEAN.JS defaults to PostgreSQL 9.4)*
 * Redis Server
 * Node.js
 * NPM

##### Using Command Line:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/seanjs-stack/seanjs.git seanjs
```
```bash
$ cd seanjs
```

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g bower
```

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

```bash
$ sudo npm install
```
You might notice some `errors` but if you hit `node server.js` and it's working, simply ignore them.

```bash
$ bower install --alow-root
```

```bash
$ node server.js
```

##### Using Yeoman Generator:

```sh
$  npm install -g yo
```
**Note:** Your user might not have the permissions to install package globally, so use a super user or **sudo**.

Once you have *yo* installed, you will need to install the **SEAN.JS** Stack generator as well:

```bash
$  npm install -g generator-seanjs
```

```bash
$ yo seanjs
```

You are now ready to get started with the SEAN.JS generator. The generator will help you create a SEAN application.


---

## Running Your Application
After the install process is over, you'll be able to run your application using Grunt, just run grunt default task:

```
$ grunt
```

Your application should run on port 3000 with the *development* environment configuration, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

That's it! Your application should be running. To proceed with your development, check the other sections in this documentation.
If you encounter any problems, try the Troubleshooting section.

* explore `config/env/development.js` for development environment configuration options

### Running in Production mode
To run your application with *production* environment configuration, execute grunt as follows:

```bash
$ grunt prod
```

* explore `config/env/production.js` for production environment configuration options

### Running with TLS (SSL)
Application will start by default with secure configuration (SSL mode) turned on and listen on port 8443.
To run your application in a secure manner you'll need to use OpenSSL and generate a set of self-signed certificates. Unix-based users can use the following command:

```bash
$ sh ./scripts/generate-ssl-certs.sh
```

Windows users can follow instructions found [here](http://www.websense.com/support/article/kbarticle/How-to-use-OpenSSL-and-Microsoft-Certification-Authority).
After you've generated the key and certificate, place them in the *config/sslcerts* folder.

Finally, execute grunt's prod task `grunt prod`
* enable/disable SSL mode in production environment change the `secure` option in `config/env/production.js`


## Testing Your Application
You can run the full test suite included with SEANJS with the test task:

```bash
$ grunt test
```

This will run both the server-side tests (located in the app/tests/ directory) and the client-side tests (located in the public/modules/*/tests/).

To execute only the server tests, run the test:server task:

```bash
$ grunt test:server
```

And to run only the client tests, run the test:client task:

```bash
$ grunt test:client
```

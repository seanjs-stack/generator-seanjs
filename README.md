Welcome to **SEAN.JS** Stack Official Yeoman Generator

**SEAN.JS** is a Full-Stack Javascript for an easy starting point with [**S**equilizeJS](http://sequelize.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), [**E**xpressJS](http://expressjs.com/), [**A**ngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [**N**odeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) based applications.
It is designed to give you a quick and organized way to start developing SEAN based web apps.

## Configured with
* [RedisStore](https://github.com/optimalbits/node_acl): Redis session store backed by node_redis, and is insanely fast!
* [ACL](https://github.com/optimalbits/node_acl): An Access Control List module, based on Redis with Express middleware support
* [Async](https://github.com/caolan/async): Higher-order functions and common patterns for asynchronous code
* [Passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport): Simple, unobtrusive authentication for Node.js (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google and PayPal)
* [Socket.io](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io): Node.js realtime framework server
* And many more...

Based on **MEAN Stack**
